A Data Science project is a structured process of using data to extract meaningful insights, build predictive models, and support decision-making. It involves multiple stages—from data collection to model deployment—using various statistical, analytical, and programming techniques.
Problem Definition

Identify the real-world problem or business question.

Data Collection

Gather data from different sources such as databases, APIs, files (CSV, Excel, SQL), or web scraping.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and correct inconsistencies.

Convert data into usable formats and normalize it for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Use statistics and visualizations (like histograms, boxplots, heatmaps) to understand data patterns and relationships.

Identify trends, outliers, and correlations.

Feature Engineering

Select or create the most relevant variables (features) that improve model performance.

Encode categorical data and scale numeric values if required.

Model Building

Apply machine learning algorithms (Regression, Classification, Clustering, etc.).

Split data into training and testing sets.

Train models and tune hyperparameters.

Model Evaluation

Assess model accuracy using metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, RMSE, or AUC.

Compare models to choose the best performer.

Deployment

Deploy the final model into a production environment (web app, dashboard, or API).

Make it accessible for end users or business applications.

Monitoring and Maintenance

Track model performance over time.

Update or retrain the model as new data becomes available.
